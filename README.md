### About The Project

I was getting increasingly frustrated with NextDNS's lack of API. I wanted to manage things on the fly. So, I did the most logical thing. I built a python script (library-to-be) to control my NextDNS account. I decided to make it public because why not?

### Built With

Built using Python:

* Requests library

#### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* requests

```
pip install requests
```

#### Installation

1. pip install nextdnsapi
2. Open your IDE
3. Import library

```py
from nextdnsapi.api import *
```

or

```py
from nextdnsapi import api
from api import *
```

1. Check [Github](https://github.com/rhijjawi/NextDNS-API) for Usage

### Usage

Usage is very easy, so I won't bother to go into the intricacies of the library, but I will go over some basic info. This library closely imitates the website.

#### Account

```python
header = account.login("example@example.com", "password123")
print(account.list(header))
#[{'id': '19nd7x', 'name': 'first config'}, {'id': '837xh82', 'name': 'other one'}]
```

#### Settings

```python
settings.listsettings(config,header)
settings.setup(config,header)
settings.clearlogs(config,header)
settings.rename(name, config, header)
settings.logclientips(bool, config, header)
settings.logdomains(bool, config, header)
settings.blockpage(bool, config, header)
settings.updatelinkedip(config,header)
```

#### Security

```python
security.list(config, header)
security.threatintelligencefeeds(bool, config, header)
security.aidetection(bool, config, header)
security.safebrowsing(bool, config, header)
security.cryptojacking(bool, config, header)
security.dnsrebinding(bool, config, header)
security.homograph(bool, config, header)
security.typosquatting(bool, config, header)
security.dga(bool, config, header)
security.newdomains(bool, config, header)
security.parked(bool, config, header)
security.csam(bool, config, header)
security.addtld(tld, config, header)
security.removetld(tld, config, header)
```

#### Privacy

```python
privacy.list(config, header)
privacy.blockdisguised(bool, config, header):
privacy.blockaffiliate(bool, config, header):
privacy.blocknative(native, config, header):
privacy.unblocknative(native, config, header):
```
